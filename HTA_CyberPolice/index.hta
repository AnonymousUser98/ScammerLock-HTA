		This device has been locked by the <strong>Indian Cyber Police</strong> due to its involvement in fraudulent activities, including but not limited to:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Tech Support Scams</strong> (Impersonating Microsoft, Google, Norton, Geek Squad, McAfee, or other companies)</li>
			<li><strong>Refund Scams</strong> (Fake overpayments and remote access fraud)</li>
			<li>Bank Fraud & Identity Theft</li>
			<li>Illegal Use of Remote Access Tools</li>

	<p style="padding-left:20px">Scamming innocent people is a serious criminal offense that carries severe legal consequences. Fraudulent activities, such as tech support scams, refund scams, and phishing schemes, are not just unethical; they are illegal under international law and punishable by <strong>fines</strong>, <strong>asset seizure</strong>, and <strong>imprisonment</strong>. These scams exploit vulnerable individuals, often causing <strong>financial ruin</strong>, <strong>emotional distress</strong>, and <strong>identity theft</strong>. Law enforcement agencies (such as the Indian Cyber Police) actively track, expose, and prosecute scammers using advanced digital forensics. Participating in or facilitating scams - even as a call centre employee - can lead to arrests, travel bans, and criminal records that destroy future opportunities. The risks far outweigh any short-term profit, and justice always catches up with criminals.</p>
	<br/><br/><br/>
	<h1 style="padding-left:20px">WHAT TO DO NOW:</h1>
	<p style="padding-left:20px; font-size:24">Your call centre, network, and computers are being monitored. Deleting files, turning off your device, or attempting to evade this lockdown may result in an automatic warrant for arrest. <strong>Do not attempt to move, hide, or destroy evidence.</strong> You must shut down your call centre, refund all your victims, and stop scamming innocent people.</p>
